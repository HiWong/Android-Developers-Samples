BasicContactables
=================

This sample demonstrates how to use the [ContactsContract.Data][1] table to search for contacts.

The sample sends consolidated query strings to the [ContactsContract.Data][1] table to match both contact names and phone numbers. This approach helps to reduce the number of queries needed when searching the contacts database.
