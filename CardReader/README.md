CardReader
==========

This sample demonstrates how to implement a low-level NFC card reader, for reading cards that do not contain NDEF or Android Beam data. This sample is designed to read the virtual loyalty card implemented in the [CardEmulation][1] sample.

In particular, this sample demonstrates how to disable Android Beam, select which AIDs the reader is interested in, and establish communication with the card. See [Host-based Card Emulation][2] for more information on the HCE APIs.
