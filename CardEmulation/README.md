CardEmulation
=============

This sample demonstrates how to emulate an NFC card, using the [Host Card Emulation][1] feature added in Android 4.4. This sample makes the device appear as a loyalty card whenever the screen is on and the user taps their device on an appropriately configured NFC reader.

The [CardReader][2] sample can be used to read the loyalty card implemented in this sample.
