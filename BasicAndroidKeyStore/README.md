BasicAndroidKeyStore
====================

This sample demonstrates how to use a {java.security.KeyStore} to safely create and store encryption keys that only your application can access. You can also sign data using those keys.

To see this in action, run the sample application and click:

* **Create** to create a new KeyPair.
* **Sign** to sign some data using a KeyPair.
* **Verify** to verify the data using the signature provided.
