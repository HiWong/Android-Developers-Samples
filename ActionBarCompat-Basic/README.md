ActionBarCompat-Basic
=====================

This sample demonstrates how to create a basic action bar that displays action items. The sample shows how to inflate items from a menu resource, and how to add items programatically. To reduce clutter, rarely used actions are displayed in an action bar overflow.

The activity in this sample extends from [ActionBarActivity][1], which provides the functionality necessary to display a compatible action bar on devices running Android 2.1 and higher.
