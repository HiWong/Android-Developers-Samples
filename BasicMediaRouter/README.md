BasicMediaRouter
================

This sample demonstrates how to use the MediaRouter API to display content on a secondary display.

To see this in action, run the sample and use the **Media Route Action Item** in the action bar to select an output device. If your device supports Miracast wireless displays, you may need to enable **Wireless Display** functionality in the system settings.

You can also enable secondary screen simulation from the Developer options in the system Settings. Once connected, use the **Change Color** button to change the background color of the secondary screen.
