AdvancedImmersiveMode
=====================

Android 4.4 introduces a way for you to provide a more immersive screen experience in your app, by letting users show or hide the status bar and navigation bar with a swipe.

This sample demonstrates how this features interacts with some of the other UI flags related to full-screen apps. The sample also shows how to implement a "sticky" mode, which re-hides the bars a few seconds after the user swipes them back in.
